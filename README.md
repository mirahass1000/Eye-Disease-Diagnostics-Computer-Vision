# Eye-Disease-Diagnostics-Computer-Vision

The purpose of this study is to employ computer vision methodologies for the advancement of eye disease classification. To ensure better patient outcomes and clinical efficiency, research focus must be on utilizing and developing robust algorithms that will progress screening/early detection, diagnisis support, and treatment of eye diseases. This computer vision model based off advanced machine learning methodolgies known as deep learning (multi-layered neural networks) will detect eyes having:
glaucoma (= 0), normal (= 1), diabetic retinopathy (= 2), and cataract (= 3).

About the diseases:

# Cataract is a common age-related eye condition characterized by the clouding of the lens, leading to blurry vision and visual impairment. It can be treated surgically by replacing the cloudy lens with an artificial one, restoring clear vision and improving quality of life.
# Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the blood vessels in the retina. It can cause vision loss, including blurred or distorted vision, and in severe cases, lead to blindness. Early detection, regular eye exams, and proper management of diabetes are crucial for preventing and managing this condition.
# Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve, often due to increased fluid pressure in the eye. It gradually leads to vision loss, starting with peripheral vision and potentially progressing to complete blindness. Timely diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing monitoring are vital for preserving vision and preventing irreversible damage.

Model Architecture: Pre-trained RestNet-18 model. ResNet-18 is composed of multiple residual blocks, which are designed to address the problem of vanishing gradients in deep neural networks. These blocks introduce skip connections, allowing information to bypass several layers and flow directly to deeper layers. This helps in mitigating the degradation problem and enables the network to learn more effectively, even with very deep architectures.
